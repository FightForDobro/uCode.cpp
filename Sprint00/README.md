### Description

Hi, friend!
Congratulations, you've already taken the first step into the world of programming. It's
time to jump into a new technology. We want to introduce you to C++, a direct descendant
of the C language. There is a big difference between these languages that we propose you
to explore in practice.
Forget about C, you are in the C++ world now!
C++ increases capabilities and has a much wider range of programming styles. In addition,
it supports object-oriented programming that improves modularity of the created software.
Welcome to the new perspective direction – C++.
Personal growth involves accumulation of gained knowledge and the stimulus to learn new
ones. Make it a habit to learn something new at least every day.

### Big Idea
Self-evolution in learning.

### Essential Question
How to build new knowledge on top of prior experience?
